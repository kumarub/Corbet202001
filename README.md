Application Name: myTAGs

About the application:

This application is designed to use Open Banking Transaction Enquiry and Payments API's and provide a Web App to user, using which he can TAG his transactions and then use those TAG's for reporting, searching, grouping and financial goal tracking. Read more about idea reading 'mTAGâ€™s v0.3.pdf' file.

More support documents with be provides, if required, like Demo of Application and Final presentation.

IMPORTANT: Due to limited time and lack of required skill in team, we could not integrate these UI screens with backend Open Banking API's. So we have adopted an approach where screens are mocked so that, atleast idea can be visualised as an end product. We will continue to make these screens live, but for now commiting at this stage.

Thanks
